Rosemary Holliday Bede Gaming Battleships 

I opted to tackle this challenge using C# by creating a web based solution.

I chose C# as this is the language I have the most experience in, and I chose to make a web based solution as I feel this is more user friendly.

I programmed in Visual Studio 17 and tested in Chrome.

I started this challenge by looking in to the requirements and creating a scope. 

I realised that I would need classes for the ships, player and board and I utilised abstract classes and inheritance to share features between related classes.

I used a procedural manner to tackle the problems, I created and populated the array, then placed the ships, allowed a user to shoot and then finally allowed for
feedback to the user for when they hit/sunk a ship and for when they won. As part of this feedback I added a bit of robustness to the design by capturing an incorrect input
and explaining this to the player.
